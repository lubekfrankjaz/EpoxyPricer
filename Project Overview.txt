// TODO
- Download, install, test GitBash (https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- Generate ssh keys. Seeing as RSA is being deprecated, use edcsa instead ("ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521" via CMD)
- Register ssh keys with GitHub (https://github.com/settings/keys)
- New folder on desktop, rename with project name, open gitbash and type "git init"
- Upload repo to GitHub by typing:
	"git status" - to verify
	"git add ." stage files
	"git commit -m [insert comment here]"
	"git push origin master"
